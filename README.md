## Notes

- Android 10+ uses the recommended `WifiNetworkSpecifier` API for connecting to WiFi.
- On older Android versions, the app uses `WifiConfiguration`.
- WiFi scanning requires location permission due to Android system restrictions.
- Preferred networks are saved in `SharedPreferences`.
- Auto-switch scans every 30 seconds to update available networks.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure location services are enabled on your device.
- If WiFi scanning doesn’t work, check if location permission is granted.
- For Android 10+, the app cannot connect to networks programmatically if the device does not support the `WifiNetworkSpecifier` API.
